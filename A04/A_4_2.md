In information theory [entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)) is defined as

\begin{equation}
S=-\sum_{i} P(x_i) \log_2 P(x_i),
\label{entropy}
\tag{entropy}
\end{equation}

where \(P\) is a probability mass function.

Then for English letter \(l∈L\) associated with letter frequency, i.e. probability of occurrence \(P(l)\), the entropy for English letter symbol space \(L\) can be calculated using the formula \(\eqref{entropy}\).

\[S = 4.175759791063625 ≈ 4.18\]

One design metric for creating an efficient [Multi-tap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-tap) text entry system is the expected number of key presses

\begin{equation}
\sum_{l∈L} P(l) ⋅ d(l),
\label{expected-key-presses}
\tag{expected-key-presses}
\end{equation}

where \(P(l)\) the frequency of the letter \(l\) and \(d\) measures how many key presses are required for inputting letter \(l\). An optimal design aims to minimize the expected number of key presses.

Optimal layout for a set of \(m\) keys can be constructed by first sorting the letters by frequency in decreasing order \(l_1, l_2, ..., l_n\) where \(P(l_1) > P(l_2) > ... > P(l_n)\) and then by assigning first \(m\) letters to first places \(d=1\) on keys, second \(m\) letters to second places \(d=2\) on keys and so on until we run out of letters, see table \ref{layout-table} . This algorithm will minimize the expected number of key presses because higher frequencys \(P(l)\) always have smaller the values \(d\) therefore minimizing \(\eqref{expected-key-presses}\).

The results from running the algorithm are:

1) Optimal layout with keys \((1, 2, ..., 9, 0)\) where \(m=10\) has expected number of key presses \(≈1.28\).

2) Optimal layout with keys \((2, 3, ..., 9)\) where \(m=8\) has an expected number of key presses \(≈1.46\).

3) The default layout with keys \((2, 3, ..., 9)\)) where \(m=8\) has expected number of key presses \(≈2.15\).

By comparing the values in the results 2 and 3, by using the optimal layout the expected number of key presses can be lowered by \(1-1.46/2.15≈32\%\) which is almost a one third!
