1) Design objectives
2) Technical approach
3) A justification why this approach should be good by reference what you learned about principles of continuous control in the lecture
4) Include a video of the 1-2 best transfer functions

The design objective is to create an efficient and well-justified transfer function for panning. A transfer function maps the movement of the input (mouse, etc) to the movement of the panner.

The three types of transfer function covered are:

- 00L-TF : Zero order lag, Position control
- 10L-TF : First order lag, Velocity control
- 20L-TF : Second order lag, Acceleration control

* Gain parameters
* Lag, how fast do we want to reach the desired position
