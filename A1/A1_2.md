Neighboring layout is defined as a layout that if is changed by a small amount creates a new layout such that the value of the objective function for the new layout differs by a small amount. In this case the function for creating neighboring layouts can be achieved by swapping two elements that are withing distance \(n\) of each other.  Since the objective function depends heavily on the distance to the first element and distance between two elements, the change in the value of the objective function is limited by the value \(n\), and therefore small if \(n\) is small.

```python
def neighbor(layout, n=1):
    """
    Returns a neighbor of a layout (list);
    has a parameter 'n' to control distance in the neighborhood (optional)
    """
    # Choose a random element from layout.
    i = random.randrange(0, len(layout))

    # Filter all elements that have distance over n.
    canditates = []
    for j in range(len(layout)):
        if i == j:
            continue
        if distance(columns, i, j) <= n:
            canditates.append(j)

    # Choose a random element from candidate elements.
    j = random.choice(canditates)

    # Swap the elements i and j.
    new_layout = layout[:]
    new_layout[i] = layout[j]
    new_layout[j] = layout[i]
    return new_layout
```
