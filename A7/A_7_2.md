The linear program for the optimization task is formulated as

$$\min \sum_{i=1}^N\sum_{j=1}^N f(d_j,w_j) \cdot p_i \cdot x_{ij} $$
$$\text{subject to} \hspace{6cm} $$
$$\sum_{i=1}^N x_{ij} = 1\hspace{1cm} \forall j = 1 .. N$$
$$\sum_{j=1}^N x_{ij} = 1\hspace{1cm} \forall i = 1 .. N$$
$$x_{ij} \in \{0, 1\} \hspace{1.6cm} \forall i, j = 1 .. N$$

where

* \(x_{ij}\) denotes if an item \(i\) is assigned to position \(j\).
* \(p_i\) is the frequency distribution of the menu items. There are two conditions that must hold for a the distribution:  \(\sum_{i=1}^N p_i = 1\) and \(p_i≥0\).
* \(d_j≥0\) is the distance of position \(j\) from the start of the menu.

The function \(f\) is the [Fitts' law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitts%27s_law) and defined as

\[
f(D,W) = a + b \log_2\left(D/W+1\right),
\label{fitts-law}
\tag{fitts-law}
\]

where \(D\) is the distance to the target, \(W\) is the width of the target and \(a\) and \(b\) are constants.

Because we are only interested in the optimal configuration of buttons not the value of the minimum solution, the parameters can be set \(a=0\) and \(b=1\). The targets are also assumed to have a constant width and they are set \(W=1\).

Two widgets \(i\) and \(i_2\) can be collocated to neighboring positions by constraining the assignments of positions

\[
\sum_{j=1}^N c(j) = 1
\]

where (\(x_{ij}\) is denoted as \(x[i,j]\))

\[
c(j) =
\begin{cases}
x[i,j] ⋅ x[i_2,j_n] + x[i_2,j] ⋅ x[i,j_n] & j_n ≠ Nan \\
0 & j_n = Nan
\end{cases}
\]

and \(j_n = \operatorname{neighbor}(j)\) is the neighboring position of \(j\).

The neighbor function can be defined for both, elements on the same row and on the same column. For example, for \(4×4\) matrix

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
  0 & 1 & 2 & 3 \\
  4 & 5 & 6 & 7 \\
  8 & 9 & 10 & 11 \\
  12 & 13 & 14 & 15
\end{bmatrix}
\]

the neighboring positions for being in the same row are \[0→1, 1→2, 2→3, 3→Nan, 4→5, ...\] and for being in the same columns are \[0→4, 4→8, 8→12, 12→Nan, 1→5, ...\].

Combined, within the code both of the constraints can be achieved by:
```python
model.addConstr(
    quicksum([x[(e1, i*columns+j)] * x[(e2, i*columns+(j+1))] +
              x[(e2, i*columns+j)] * x[(e1, i*columns+(j+1))] +
              x[(e1, i * columns + j)] * x[(e2, (i + 1) * columns + j)] +
              x[(e2, i * columns + j)] * x[(e1, (i + 1) * columns + j)]
              for i in range(rows-1)
              for j in range(columns-1)]) == 1,
    f"Elements {e1}{e2} are colocated")
```
